    <h1>First, Last and Only</h1>
    <p>The AMC MUSEUM is proud to be home to a number of significant vintage aircraft.  All of the museum's aircraft are relevant to our American heritage but the following planes stand out as historically important.</p>
    <h2>C-5A "Galaxy"</h2>
    <p>The First & Only C-5A "Galaxy" in history that launched an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) in-flight.  In October 1974, 69-0014 air dropped an 86,000 lb ICBM from 20,000 feet over the Pacific Oceanto give the U.S. one more option in basing our strategic missile inventory.  0014 was the first "Factory New" C-5A assigned to Dover AFB in 1973 and in November 2013, it moved to the AMC Museum marking the first time a C-5 was retired to a museum.</p>
    <h2>C-141A "Starlifter"</h2>
    <p>The First C-141A "Starlifter", Serial Number 61-2775, was the first of 284 C-141's.  It first flew on 17 December, 1963, 60 years to the day from the Wright Brothers' first flight.  It was the first jet aircraft specifically designed as a cargo plane.  It is one of only two remaining "A" models.  The only known 4 engine jet used to tow a glider.  Used during NASA testing of shuttle launch operations.</p>
    <h2>C-141B "Starlifter"</h2>
    <p>The last C-141B "Starlifter", Serial Number 64-0626, assigned to Dover AFB.  The last C-141 to be transferred to another base when Dover AFB transitioned to all C-5 operations.</p>
