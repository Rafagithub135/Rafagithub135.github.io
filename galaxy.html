<h3>Flight Deck</h3>
<h4>Cockpit</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>Crew Area</h4>
<p>Behind the cockpit, is an area for additional crew members.  There are two rooms with 3 bunks each for relief crews to sleep.  Behind the bunk rooms, is an area where the relief crew can relax, sit at a table to eat or play games among other activities.</p>
<h4>Distinguished Visitor Seating</h4>
<p>Aft of the Crew Area, there is a small section with 8 seats for Generals, Distinguished Visitors or, if the plane is carrying classified cargo, a courier may be seated in this area.  This area also includes the galley which contains a sink, oven, coffee pot and a can opener (all the comforts of home) for the crew to use.  The forward lavitory/bathroom is also located in this area.  The lavitory is about the same size as 3 or 4 bathrooms on a commercial plane.</p>
<h4>Environmental Control</h4>
<p>The environmental control system outputs enough heat and cooling to heat or cool 8 average U.S. houses.</p>
<h3>Passenger Area</h3>
<p>The passenger area is located above the cargo deck aft of the wings.  It is accessed from the ladder in the roof above the rear ramp.  There are 75 seats of which, 3 are designated for crew members.  There is a galley which contains 2 refrigerators, and 2 ovens.  There is a lavatory located in the forward area of the passenger system.  The seats face to the rear in the unlikely event that the plane would crash.  The plane would most likely be moving forward and the passenger's back would be against the seat back.  It therefore would have less stress on the body and the passenger would have a higher chance of survival.</p>
<h3>Cargo Deck</h3>
<p>The cargo deck is the main mission for the C-5.  The cargo deck can fit 36 pallets of cargo or vehicles, aircraft and just about anything that can fit within the walls.  6 Greyhound style buses can fit on the cargo deck (2 columns of 3 rows). 7 intact UH-1 Huey's can fit, ready to fly so when the plane lands, they can be pre-flighted and take off immediately.</p>
