    <h2>Quote # 1</h2>
    <p>"You're only young once, but you can be immature forever."</p>
    <p>I first heard this quote from former Philadelphia Phillies pitcher, and current Philadelphia Phillies Color
        Announcer Larry Anderson. I thought it was his quote but after some research, azquotes.com credits Germaine
        Greer with the quote. You only live once and no one knows how long any of us have to live. So live your life and
        enjoy because even if you have 100 years, it still feels too short.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 2</h2>
    <p>"Two feet."</p>
    <p>When I was in Marine Corps Boot Camp in San Diego, California (Yes, I am a Hollywood Marine), we travelled to
        Camp Pendleton for the rifle range. Just prior to us qualifying, our instructor, trying to get us to relax,
        asked if we had any questions. One recruit raised his hand and asked about humping to Mount Motherfucker. The
        instructor turned around and looked at the mountain range behind him. He asked, "Do you see that mountain right
        there?" "Yes sir." the recruit replied. "That's Mount Motherfucker. About how far do you think that is from
        here?" The recruit replied, "About 10 miles." "That's about right." the instructor answered back. "Now, look
        down." the recruit did, and the instructor asked, "Now how far is it?" Without hesitation, the recruit replied,
        "Two feet." After that moment, anywhere I needed to travel, and didn't have transportation to get there, I've
        remembered that quote.</p>
