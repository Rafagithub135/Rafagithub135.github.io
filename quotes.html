    <h2>Quote # 1</h2>
    <p>"You're only young once, but you can be immature forever."</p>
    <p>I first heard this quote from former Philadelphia Phillies pitcher, and current Philadelphia Phillies Color
        Announcer Larry Anderson. I thought it was his quote, but after some research, azquotes.com credits Germaine
        Greer with the quote. You only live once, and no one knows how long any of us have to live. So live your life to the fullest and
        enjoy because even if you have 100 years, it still feels too short.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 2</h2>
    <p>"Two feet."</p>
    <p>When I was in Marine Corps Boot Camp in San Diego, California (Yes, I am a Hollywood Marine), we travelled to
        Camp Pendleton for the rifle range. Just prior to us qualifying, our instructor, trying to get us to relax,
        asked if we had any questions. One recruit raised his hand and asked about humping to Mount Motherfucker. The
        instructor turned around and looked at the mountain range behind him. He asked, "Do you see that mountain right
        there?" "Yes sir." the recruit replied. "That's Mount Motherfucker. About how far do you think that is from
        here?" The recruit replied, "About 10 miles." "That's about right." the instructor answered back. "Now, look
        down." the recruit did, and the instructor asked, "Now how far is it?" Without hesitation, the recruit replied,
        "Two feet." After that moment, anywhere I needed to travel, and didn't have transportation to get there, I've
        remembered that quote and walked. The ability to get somewhere is only limited by the strength of the desire to get there and the will to use the resources available at the time.  If you have two feet, you can walk.  If you don't think you can walk the distance, maybe you don't really need to go.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 3</h2>
    <p>"War isn't Hell. War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse."</p>
    <p>In the TV series M*A*S*H, Season 5, Episode 20, while in the operating room, Frank Burns says, "Everybody knows
        war is Hell." After a short remark from B.J., Pierce says the above quote. After Father Mulcahy inquires to
        Pierce's logic, Hawkeye goes on to clarify that only sinners go to Hell and that there are no innocent
        bystanders. But War is full of innocent people, children, old ladies, and even the soldiers fighting the war
        are, for the most part, innocent.  War is an ugly business.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 4</h2>
    <p>"A person should be so deep in study that he forgets to eat, so full of joy in learning he ignores all practical worries, and so busy acquiring knowledge he does not notice old age coming on."</p>
    <p>This quote, is not necessarily a quote.  I got it from a publication entitled, "Socrates A Man for Our Times" by Paul Johnson.  It is said that the words I've written here were, according to the pupils of Confucius, Confucius' view.  But I like the attitude of taking what you desire, and getting it by the dedication it takes to work on it.  Work at your job so deeply that you don't realize it's lunchtime.  It doesn't have to be education, that was just Confucius' passion.  This quote uses the premise of if you like what you do, it's not really work.  Professional athletes get paid to play a game they love.  Their passion for that game drives them to perform better, which keeps them playing at a professional level.  Find a career that does something you love and dedicate yourself to excelling at it.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 5</h2>
    <p>To me, you're a genius.  To O'Mally, you're a genius.  But to a genius, you're no genius.</p>
    <p>In 2011, the Canadian Rock band, Rush made a video as a prelude to open up their concerts.  In the video, Geddy Lee (Bass, Vocals, Keyboards) plays an owner (assumed) of a sausage diner.  Neil Peart (Percussion/Lyricist, Professor) plays a cop (O'Mally) and Alex Lifeson (Guitars, Keyboards) plays a music producer.  One of the lines Geddy says to Alex is the quote. You might think you are the smartest person in the world.  But, there could always be someone who is more intelligent, or more experienced on a subject than you are.  Proceed with caution.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 6</h2>
    <p>"When you have to shoot, shoot.  Don't talk."</p>
    <p>In the movie, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, the character Tuco Ramirez brother of Brother Ramirez finds himself in a bombed out building, but there is a bathtub with water in it.  So he decides to take a bath.  While he is in the bath, a gunslinger from his past visits him and begins a soliloquy about how he has dreamt of killing Tuco.  Just at the end of the man's speech, Tuco shoots him dead and tells him the above quote.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 7</h2>
    <p>If you were your own employer, would you be entirely satisfied with the day's work you have done today?</p>
    <p>When you finished your job today, or the last day you worked, did you give it your all?  Or did you leave some gas in the tank?  Would you want you to come back to work if you were your boss, or coworker?  This quote sortof relates back to Quote # 4.  Do you have a passion for your job?  But, it is different as how to look at your own performance.  Is there something you could have done to complete your tasks sooner, better, with a better result?  Look at your job from your bosses perspective.  If you were your boss, would you want you to work for you?  If not, consider a change, either a different job, or a better performance.  Better performance could lead to better pay and promotions.  A different job (if you are not satisfied with your current one) could lead to a career you enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 8</h2>
    <p>If it isn't your job to do it, perhaps it is your opportunity.</p>
    <p>If you see a job that has to be done, you have two choices.  Do the job, or do nothing.  If you do the job, someone may notice that you took the initiative to go above and beyond.  That could reward you in the end.  If a supervisor notices you took the initiative, they may put more responsibility on you which could lead to promotion and/or pay raises.  If a supervisor notices and doesn't reward you, it could be a sign that you need to look for a different company that will recognize a person who will do other people's work and will reward you.  If you do nothing, it may lead to someone else getting a promotion or pay raise that you could have had.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 9</h2>
    <p>There is a vast difference between failure and temporary defeat.</p>
    <p>If you are working on a project and don't achieve the desired result on the first try, you have only been temporarily defeated.  As long as you continue to pursue the goal, you have not failed.  You only fail when you quit trying and still have not achieved the goal.</p>

<div class="quote10">
    <h2>Quote # 10</h2>
    <p>No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.</p>
    <p>This quote is credited to Eleanor Roosevelt.  Words cannot physically hurt you.  They have no power over you that you don't give them.  If someone calls you a name, you can leave or ignore the person saying the word or words.  But speech will not physically injure you if you are strong enough to prevent it.  It is your choice.</p>
