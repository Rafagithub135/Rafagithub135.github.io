    <h2>Quote # 1</h2>
    <p>"You're only young once, but you can be immature forever."</p>
    <p>I first heard this quote from former Philadelphia Phillies pitcher, and current Philadelphia Phillies Color
        Announcer Larry Anderson. I thought it was his quote but after some research, azquotes.com credits Germaine
        Greer with the quote. You only live once and no one knows how long any of us have to live. So live your life and
        enjoy because even if you have 100 years, it still feels too short.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 2</h2>
    <p>"Two feet."</p>
    <p>When I was in Marine Corps Boot Camp in San Diego, California (Yes, I am a Hollywood Marine), we travelled to
        Camp Pendleton for the rifle range. Just prior to us qualifying, our instructor, trying to get us to relax,
        asked if we had any questions. One recruit raised his hand and asked about humping to Mount Motherfucker. The
        instructor turned around and looked at the mountain range behind him. He asked, "Do you see that mountain right
        there?" "Yes sir." the recruit replied. "That's Mount Motherfucker. About how far do you think that is from
        here?" The recruit replied, "About 10 miles." "That's about right." the instructor answered back. "Now, look
        down." the recruit did, and the instructor asked, "Now how far is it?" Without hesitation, the recruit replied,
        "Two feet." After that moment, anywhere I needed to travel, and didn't have transportation to get there, I've
        remembered that quote.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 3</h2>
    <p>"War isn't Hell. War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse."</p>
    <p>In the TV series M*A*S*H, Season 5, Episode 20, while in the operating room, Frank Burns says, "Everybody knows
        war is Hell. After a short remark from B.J., Pierce says the above quote. After Father Mulcahy inquires to
        Pierce's logic, Hawkeye goes on to clarify that only sinners go to Hell and that there are no innocent
        bystanders. But War is full of innocent people, children, old ladies, and even the soldiers fighting the war
        are, for the most part, innocent.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 4</h2>
    <p>"A person should be so deep in study that he forgets to eat, so full of joy in learning he ignores all practical worries, and so busy acquiring knowledge he does not notice old age coming on."</p>
    <p>This quote, is not necessarily a quote.  I got it from a publication entitled, "Socrates A Man for Our Times" by Paul Johnson.  It is said that the words I've written here were, according to the pupils of Confucius, Confucius' view.  But I like the attitude of taking what you desire, and getting it by the dedication it takes to work on it.  Work at your job so deeply that you don't realize it's lunchtime.  It doesn't have to be education, that was just Confucius' passion.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 5</h2>
    <p>To me, you're a genius.  To O'Mally, you're a genius.  But to a genius, you're no genius.</p>
    <p>In 2011, the Canadian Rock band, Rush made a video as a prelude to open up their concerts.  In the video, Geddy Lee (Bass, Vocals, Keyboards) plays an owner (assumed) of a sausage diner.  Neil Peart (Percussion/Lyricist, Professor) plays a cop (O'Mally) and Alex Lifeson (Guitars, Keyboards) plays a music producer.  One of the lines Geddy says to Alex is the quote.

    <h2>Quote # 6</h2>
    <p>"When you have to shoot, shoot.  Don't talk."</p>
    <p>In the movie, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, the character Tuco Ramirez brother of bBrother Ramirez finds himself in a bombed out building, but there is a bathtub with water in it.  So he decides to take a bath.  While he is in the bath, a gunslinger from his past visits him and begins a soliloquy about how he has dreamt of killing Tuco.  Just at the end of the man's speech, Tuco shoots him dead and tells him the above quote.</p>

    <h2>Quote # 7</h2>
    <p>If you were your own employer, would you be entirely satisfied with the day's work you have done today?</p>
    <p>When you finished your job today, or the last day you worked, did you give it your all?  Or did you leave some gas in the tank?  Would you want you to come back to work if you were your boss, or coworker?</p>
