<p>The museum acquired 44-83624 in 1989.  44-83624 had no combat history of its own.  A seven year restoration project was begun to display the aircraft as a tribute to the 381st Bomb Group's 532nd Squadron's "Sleepy Time Gal", 42-107112.  "Sleepy Time Gal" was a veteran of 47 missions, including strategic bombing of Berlin, Essen, Bremen and Schweinfurt, and ground support missions in Normandy.  The war in Europe ended in May 1945.  "Sleepy Time Gal" returned to the United States on May 29, 1945.  The 381st was inactivated on August 28, 1945.  "Sleepy Time Gal", 42-107112 was sold for scrap on November 18, 1945.</p>
