    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>1. The Curtiss C-46 Commando is a twin-engine transport aircraft derived from the Curtiss CW-20 pressurized high-altitude airliner design, although the C-46 was not pressurized.</p>
    <p>2. It is a twin-engine military transport aircraft, powered by two 2,000 hp. Pratt & Whitney R-2800-51 radial piston engines.  It is fitted with a large cargo door on the port (left) side of the fuselage, a strengthened cargo floor, a hydraulic winch and folding seats for up to 40 troops.</p>
    <p>3. This aircraft was used by the Chinese government under name of the China National Aviation Corp. (CNAC), Civil Air Transport China (CAT) and later with commercial airlines.</p>
    <p>4. The C-46 served in a similar role to its Douglas-built counterpart, the C-47 Skytrain, but it was not as extensively produced as the latter.</p>
    <p>5. After World War II, a few surplus C-46 aircraft were briefly used in their original role as passenger airliners but the glut of surplus C-47's dominated the marketplace, and the C-46 was soon relegated to cargo duty.</p>
    <p>6. The C-46 continued in U.S. Air Force service in the Korean War and in a secondary role until 1968.</p>
