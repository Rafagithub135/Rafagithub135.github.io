            continue
            service in the Nevada Air National Guard. I discovered there was an Air National Guard Station near my
            home,
            so
            I transferred to the California Air National Guard. I applied for and was accepted in to Secure
            Communications
            to repair communication equipment. While I was waiting for my security clearance to be approved, the
            superintendent of the motor pool learned that I was a Former Marine with
            vehicle maintenance experience, and he recruited me to apply for a full-time position that was currently
            available. After
            the application process, I was hired as the full-time mechanic. At one point, the dispatcher remarked to
            me
            as I
            was
            turning in paperwork that I was completing the work too fast, and I was going to work myself out of a

        <p id="angt" class="text3"> In September 1997, I joined the Air National Guard located at the Reno
            International Airport. The Aerial Port handles all manner of duties associated with air travel. Most of
            the
            positions you see at the airport are handled by Aerial Port i.e. Passenger Service, Food Service/Crew &
            Passenger
            Meals,
            and Cargo Loading. In Reno, the main mission was Air Drop which centered around dropping pallets or
            personnel.
            We
            used sandbags that simulated personnel and pallets of different weights that simulated different
            configurations
            of
            cargo to be dropped. When the mission is dropping pallets, someone has to be at the drop location to
            pick up the pallets, load them on a truck and drive them back to the base. I operated both equipment
            (forklifts) to pick up the pallets and load them on the 40' trailer, and the tractor trailer to haul the
            pallets back to the base. In my position, I operated loaders (flat topped vehicles with a driver cab)
            used to
            load
            pallets onto aircraft, fork lifts of various sizes, tractor trailer with 40' flat bed used for return
            transportation
            of pallets after they were dropped, and other (civilian-type) vehicles.</p>

        <p id="apttt" class="text3">I started with All Points Towing as a tow truck operator after speaking with the
            owner and asking him what he needed. His reply was "Drivers!". I worked the overnight shift and as my
            seniority grew, I eventually became the person other drivers would turn to for instructions or advise.
            Over time, I acquired a knack for taking customers of AAA and All Points to their home cities instead of
            returning to Reno. With my background as a mechanic, when the company needed someone to repair the
            trucks, I worked to keep the fleet on the road. I assisted the dispatchers with coordinating drivers and
            connecting them with customers to keep the time spent on the side of the road to a minimum. My
            experience as an operator helped me as I often put myself in the place of the operators on the road. At
            one point, the opportunity arose to travel to Las Vegas to be tested as a Nationally Certified Tow
            Operator, I passed.</p>
