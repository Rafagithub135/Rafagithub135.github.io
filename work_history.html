        <p id="cangt">Vehicle Mechanic/Secure Communications - At the end of 1999, I moved to San Diego where I was going to
            continue
            service in the Nevada Air National Guard. I discovered there was an Air National Guard Station near my home,
            so
            I transferred to the California Air National Guard. I applied for and was accepted in to Secure
            Communications
            to repair communication equipment. While I was waiting for my security clearance to be approved, the
            superintendent of the motor pool learned that I was a Former Marine with
            vehicle maintenance experience, and he recruited me to apply for a full-time position that was currently
            available. After
            the application process, I was hired as the full-time mechanic. At one point, the dispatcher remarked to me
            as I
            was
            turning in paperwork that I was completing the work too fast, and I was going to work myself out of a job.
            In
            October 2002,
            my position was dissolved.</p>

        <p id="angt">Aerial Port - In September 1997, I joined the Air National Guard located at the Reno

            Meals,

            personnel.
            We
            used sandbags that simulated personnel and pallets of different weights that simulated different
            configurations
            of
            cargo to be dropped. In my position, I operated loaders (flat topped vehicles with a driver cab) used to

            pallets onto aircraft, fork lifts of various sizes, tractor trailer with 40' flat bed used for return
            transportation
